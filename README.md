#### Instructions
In this repository you will find the program Sort, containing the driver file _Sort.pde_ and the class file _SortArray.pde_. You do not need to modify the driver file. You will control the program with the following keyboard commands:

- r: Reset the program.
- Right arrow: Move forward once in the sorting algorithm.
- Space bar: Toggle on/off to continuously run the sorting algorithm.
- 1: Set the sorting algorithm to Bubble sort.
- 2: Set the sorting algorithm to Selection sort.


Your job is to write the `bubbleSortOnce()` and `selectionSortOnce` methods in `SortArray`. Use the appropriate instance variables provided. In the case of Bubble sort, comments have been added to aid in your coding.
